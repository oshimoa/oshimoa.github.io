  <p>My programming skills have improved in the small aspects of being more efficient by using shortcuts like find and replace (I think I finally got the hang of it T-T) and knowing what to look up to solve my problems or find information. I need to work on actual memorization because I have not been very good at memorizing syntax or formats, so I often have to reference examples which takes up time. I could also improve on breaking down the problem into smaller steps instead of trying to solve the whole problem at once. I did do the WODs without the screencasts and I did learn from them, especially when I did them after the Labs. However, I did feel a little unprepared for the algorithm WODs since it was such a new way of thinking, it was hard to get used to. While the labs did help me learn, I wish we completed more of the labs in class instead of having to do more than we were supposed to at home. I learned a lot from Assignment 1 like integrating previous WODs to work together cohesively, but Iâ€™m still a little nervous for Assignment 2 since it is using registration and login. I think the class could be improved by providing vocabulary sheets with examples because I definitely struggled with memorizing the various terms. What helps me most are the labs and working with classmates. The labs provide good examples of what needs to be done for the assignments and working with classmates on things like the WODs really helped when I was absolutely clueless and needed to see examples of how to solve certain problems.</p>
