  <p><b>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards).</b><br />
My system is a store selling accessories including earrings, rings, bracelets, and necklaces.<br />
<b>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</b><br />
I was having a problem with nodemailer and getting it to send out the invoice. It was originally working, but I broke it at some point and had to figure out how to fix it.<br />
<b>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</b><br />
I am most proud about the cart functionality of the store. I think it looks aesthetically pleasing with the picture of the products.<br />
<b>Describe what you are least happy with your system:</b><br />
I am least happy about the look of the store, I think the design is plain and the navbar could use some work.<br />
<b>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</b><br />
Developing this assignment was much more complicated than Assignment 2 and required a broader perspective since everything had to work together. Working with cookies was also kind of difficult to initially figure out.<br />
<b>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</b><br />
When I ran into a problem, I first tried to see if there were any spelling errors and if there weren’t, I would read the whole function to see if I was missing something or if it was in the right place.<br />
<b>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</b><br />
What worked well was trying to first imagine what needed to be done and in what order and then writing the skeleton of the code in comments to do this before filling it in.<br />
<b>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</b><br />
What did not work well was testing a lot of code at once instead of stopping to test every few lines (ran into a lot of problems like this).<br />
<b>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</b><br />
I learned about cookies and implementing them into html and javascript. I also learned a lot about communication which was essesntial to my partner and I’s success.<br />
<b>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</b><br />
What I would do differently is I would focus purely on one aspect of the assignment at a time instead of trying to figure out how everything would fit together all at once.<br />
<b>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</b><br />
I spent 30% of the time thinking about how to do something, 45% writing the code, and 25% debugging and testing.<br />
<b>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</b><br />
I did about 55% of the work like designing the store, adding the logout feature, setting up the product pages, adding the cart and the invoice page. I also set up a nodemailer to send out the invoices.
My partner did about 45% of the work. She created the admin backend that allows authorized users to edit store and user information and completed IR2 and IR5.</p>
