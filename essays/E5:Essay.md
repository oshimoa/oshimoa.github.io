Assignment 2 was about creating an online store that included personalization by allowing users to register by creating an account. Once users create an account, they can also login instead of registering each time. I learned about implementing code sequentially since users needed to first be able to view the products before registering and they needed to register before being able to login. I did about 45% of the work and my partner did about 55%. Besides my partner, I asked the TAs and the professor when I needed help. I had some issues with getting theinvoice to generate after the login. This assignment was different from Assignment 1 in that we needed to focus on primarily the registration and security portion rather than designing the store. I spent 25% of the time thinking about how to do something, 45% writing the code, and 30% debugging and testing. What worked well was trying to first imagine what needed to be done and in what order and then writing the skeleton of the code to do this before filling it in. What I would do differently is I would focus purely on one aspect of the assignment at a time instead of trying to figure out how the register and login would work together all at once. This definitely caused a lot of confusion when it came to writing the code.
